# Kubernetes
In this assignment, you will deploy the microservices that you developed in previous assignments into a Kubernetes cluster. We will use the Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) provided by Amazon Web Services1. We will base the guidelines for using EKS on the quickstart guide, specifically that using kubectl and eksctl2, and we will use EC2 to deploy the worker nodes in the cluster.

Note: You should not leave the cluster or database running for a long time, or you may incur substantial cost.  Read the specification first of all to understand what you have to do, then set some time aside to deploy and demonstrate the AWS resources.  You should delete the cluster and database when you are finished, to avoid further AWS costs.
