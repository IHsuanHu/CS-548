# Service-Oriented Architecture

In this assignment, we add a service layer to the application from the previous assignment.  The services represent the use case scenarios for the application, orchestrating the domain logic.  This service layer connects the domain model to a Web application representing the presentation logic.  Later we will add Web service support for adding data to the database, for now we are only able to query it.

### Assignment code
After finish the code, use Maven build tool in Intellij to build .jar file. Here are steps:
1. clinic-root -> Lifecycle -> clean
2. install
3. There will be a clinic-webapp.war in the folder: ```C:\Users\user\tmp\cs548```
