# CS-548 Enterprise Software Architecture and Design

## Course Description
This course covers the issues in designing and engineering large enterprise software systems. Technologies such as Web Services and cloud computing provide platforms for building such systems, and architectures such as microservices, event-driven architecture (EDA) and representational state transfer (REST) are idioms for structuring such systems. This course will focus on analysis and design of enterprise software systems, with particular emphasis on the architectures recommended for such systems. The emphasis of the course is on “design patterns” that the working software engineer for enterprise systems can use to develop modern enterprise applications in the cloud. The course also considers data modeling, including JSON Schemas, semantic data modeling (RDF and OWL), object-relational modeling (ORM) and NoSQL data modeling, as well as business process modeling from the viewpoint of high-level workflow models such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Assignments include hands-on experience with tools such as Intellij IDEA, Jakarta EE, Micro Profile,
Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon AWS and Hyperledger Fabric, including building simple enterprise applications exemplifying the principles of the course

## Course Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:

- [Architectures] Explain the use of architectural styles such as domain-driven, resource-oriented, microservice, serverless and event-driven software architectures, and the principles and best practices underlying those architectures.
- [Data Modeling] Perform data modeling using modeling languages such as JSON Schemas, object-relational mapping (ORM), semantic data modeling using RDFS and OWL, and NoSQL data models such as DocumentDB and Cassandra. 
- [Applications] Develop and deploy enterprise applications, including the use of containers and dependency injection. 
- [Processes] Specify workflows for enterprise applications using approaches such as BPMN and Petri net-based workflow languages.
